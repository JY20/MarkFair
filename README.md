## Inspiration

Web3 startups struggle to get noticed, while KOLs and creators spend hours chasing opportunities. Traditional campaigns lack transparency and security ‚Äî both advertisers and creators risk being "rugged." We wanted a **fair, efficient way** to connect the two worlds with on-chain escrow and verifiable attribution.

Our team brings together diverse expertise from top academic institutions and industry leaders:

- **Atlas** - Frontend Developer | Alibaba
- **Jimmy** - Full Stack Developer | McMaster University & RBC Capital Markets
- **Leo** - Backend Developer | University of Utah
- **Mark** - Smart Contract Developer | New York University

With backgrounds spanning blockchain development, finance, and enterprise software, our team combines technical expertise with business acumen to build a platform that addresses real market needs.

## What it does

- **Advertisers**: Create campaigns and deposit funds into a Starknet escrow contract.  
- **KOLs**: Receive personalized shortlinks to share with their audiences.  
- **Users**: Simply click the link ‚Äî attribution is seamless, no extra steps.  
- **Settlement**: At the end of each epoch, a Merkle Root is generated. Advertisers can review results, KOLs can claim their rewards, and unclaimed funds are automatically refunded to advertisers.

## How we built it

- **Frontend**: React + Clerk for authentication and campaign/KOL dashboards.  
- **Backend**: FastAPI for shortlink generation, attribution binding, and ROI aggregation.  
- **On-chain**: Starknet smart contracts using OpenZeppelin-based Merkle Root verification to secure escrow deposits and epoch-based settlements.

## Challenges we ran into

- **Documentation mismatch**: Starknet docs and OpenZeppelin standards differed, requiring significant work to standardize Merkle Root generation.  
- **Settlement design**: Needed to balance KOL claims with advertiser safety; we chose a model where unclaimed rewards are refunded to advertisers.  
- **Seamless attribution**: Designed shortlink-based binding for a frictionless user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Built a working MVP demonstrating **secure on-chain escrow + Merkle Root settlements**.  
- Achieved **frictionless attribution** with shortlink-based binding.  
- Established a complete pipeline: advertiser deposit ‚Üí KOL distribution ‚Üí user click ‚Üí ROI tracking ‚Üí settlement/refund.

## What we learned

- **ROI is the real KPI**: Web3 marketing success depends on proving ROI, not just raw user counts.  
- **User experience is king**: Invisible attribution flows increase adoption.  
- **Standardization is critical**: Documentation and library divergence makes standardization essential.

## What's next for MarkFair

1. **Standardized ROI metrics**: Use NFT/token mints on link click for public, transparent ROI tracking.  
2. **Multi-platform expansion**: Support TikTok, Twitter(X), Xiaohongshu, and more.  
3. **AI matching engine**: Recommend optimal KOL‚Äìadvertiser pairings for efficient campaigns.  
4. **Dynamic escrow pools**: Support epoch-based fund release (e.g. 3-month campaign, payouts every 3 days) for better liquidity.  
5. **Yield integration**: Stake escrowed funds to offset lock-up costs and generate yield for advertisers.

## Vision

The bigger picture is simple. Web3 projects, especially early-stage startups, desperately need marketing to survive. MarkFair makes sure they have a one-stop shop to find the right voices to spread their message. For KOLs, it means a steady flow of jobs, rewards, and time saved by having everything in one place.
